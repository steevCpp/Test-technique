If you want to write a well-structured text first be clear about the central theme then define the main ideas you want to present.
Arrange them in a hierarchical order and write a short conclusion.
Write your first draft,
 without stopping to correct mistakes and letting your imagination run wild instead.
Finally make any necessary corrections and look for vocabulary you may need to polish your writing.
